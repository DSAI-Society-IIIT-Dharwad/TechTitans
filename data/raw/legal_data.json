Your brother’s presence is needed only for one day for signing; alternatively, he can give a notarized and apostilled Power of Attorney from the U.S. to you.\n\nTalk to Advocate Siddharth Jain\n\nYou have informed that your mother was the registered owner of a residential house (G + 2 floors) situated at Rajendranagar, Hyderabad. Your mother passed away in the year 2019. After her death, your father obtained a legal-heir certificate. Your father has also passed away two years ago. You and your elder brother are the only surviving legal heirs. You now wish to have the property formally recorded in the joint names of both sons.\n\nUnder the applicable law, once the owner of a property dies intestate (without leaving a will), the property devolves upon the legal heirs in accordance with theHindu Succession Act, 1956. Since your mother was the registered owner and your father survived her, the property first devolved jointly upon your father and the two children. After your father’s subsequent demise, his one-third share devolves equally upon both sons. Therefore, as of date, you and your brother together hold complete ownership of the house in equal proportion.\n\nTo formalise the title in revenue and registration records, the following procedure must be adopted.\n\n1. Obtain or update the Legal Heir Certificate.– Since your father’s legal-heir certificate was issued after your mother’s death, you will now need a fresh legal-heir certificate in respect of your father, showing both sons as heirs.– Application is made to the Tahsildar, Rajendranagar Mandal, through the Mee-Seva Centre.– Attach copies of your father’s death certificate, Aadhar cards, family ration card, and notarised affidavit of heirs.– Processing time is usually 2 to 3 weeks.\n\n2. Collect Death Certificates of both parents.Certified copies from GHMC birth and death section are mandatory; they must be attached to every subsequent application.\n\n3. Prepare a Written Declaration or Deed of Partition / Settlement.Since there are only two heirs and no dispute, the simplest way to record ownership is by executing a Deed of Family Settlement or Memorandum of Partition, declaring that both brothers are co-owners in equal share of the said property.– This deed should recite the chain of title (original sale deed in mother’s name, her death, father’s death, and present heirs).– It should be signed by both brothers and two witnesses before the Sub-Registrar, Rajendranagar (SRO).\n\n4. Documents required at the time of registration.– Original parent title deed (sale deed in mother’s name).– Latest EC (Encumbrance Certificate) for 30 years (downloadable from Dharani Portal).– Death certificates of both parents.– Legal-heir certificates of both.– Aadhar and PAN cards of both sons.– Passport copies and OCI cards / visa for your brother (since he is a U.S. citizen).– Two passport-size photographs of each party.– Current property tax receipt, GHMC mutation extract, and electricity bill.\n\n5. If your brother cannot be in India for the entire process.– He may execute a Power of Attorney (PoA) in favour of you to complete registration formalities.– This PoA must be signed before the Indian Consulate in the U.S., then couriered to you and adjudicated (stamped) in Hyderabad within 3 months under the Indian Stamp Act.– Once adjudicated, you can sign and register the deed on his behalf.\n\n6. Registration cost.– For a family-settlement or partition deed between legal heirs, the stamp duty is concessional in Telangana: usually ₹1,000 stamp duty + ₹1,000 registration fee + ₹100 user charges per document (approx.).– Miscellaneous costs (EC, certified copies, drafting, service charges) may total ₹2,000–₹3,000.– Advocate or document-writer fees may vary from ₹5,000 to ₹10,000 depending on drafting and liaison work.\n\n7. Mutation in GHMC / Property Tax records.– After registration, submit the registered copy to the GHMC Circle Office (Revenue Section) for mutation.– Attach the new deed, death certificates, and legal-heir certificate.– Mutation will update the property tax records to show both sons as owners.– Processing time is typically 15 days.\n\n8. Time frame.– Collecting documents and obtaining the fresh legal-heir certificate: 2–3 weeks.– Drafting and registration of the deed: 1 day.– Mutation: 2 weeks.In all, if both heirs are available and documents ready, the entire process can be completed in about 4 to 6 weeks. If your brother executes a PoA from abroad, allow an additional 2 to 3 weeks for adjudication and courier.\n\nIn conclusion, you and your brother, as the only legal heirs of both deceased parents, are entitled to have the Rajendranagar house recorded in your joint names. The lawful method is to execute and register a family-settlement or partition deed supported by death and heir certificates, followed by mutation in GHMC records. The total official cost will be nominal, within ₹3,000 to ₹5,000 exclusive of professional charges, and the entire procedure can be completed within six weeks if documents are in order.\n\nTalk to Advocate Yuganshu Sharma\n\nSince your father died without a Will (intestate), the property will be distributed according to theHindu Succession Act, 1956 (assuming the family is Hindu). The process you will follow is called a\"Succession Certificate\"or, more efficiently for immovable property, a\"Legal Heirship Mutation\"combined with a\"Registered Partition Deed and Release Deed\".\n\nHere is the complete procedure, document list, costs, and timeline.\n\nA. Understanding the Legal Succession\n\nAfter your mother's death (2019):The house became the property of her legal heirs. As per law, this includes her husband (your father) and her two sons (you and your brother). Each had a 1/3rd share.\n\nAfter your mother's death (2019):The house became the property of her legal heirs.

The Step-by-Step Procedure & Documents\n\nThe entire process can be broken down into two main parts:\n\nPart 1: Mutation (Updating Land Records in Municipal Records)\n\nThis process updates the property records at the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) to reflect you and your brother as the new owners. This is crucial for receiving property tax bills in your names.\n\nProcess:You need to apply for \"Mutation\" or \"Name Transfer\" at the GHMC office. You will do this based on aSuccession Affidavit.\n\nProcess:You need to apply for \"Mutation\" or \"Name Transfer\" at the GHMC office.

Since you are both agreeing to hold the property equally, you will execute a\"Partition Deed and Release Deed\".\n\nProcess:You and your brother draft a \"Partition Deed\" stating that you are the legal heirs of your parents and have mutually agreed to hold the property at [address] equally, with undivided 50% share each.Since you are not physically dividing the building, it's an \"oral partition\" confirmed by a deed.
