## üî¨ Pattern Matching Algorithm

### How It Works:

```python
def find_best_match(userQuery: string):
  1. Convert query to lowercase
  2. Split into words
  3. For each knowledge entry:
     - Score based on keyword matches
     - Partial word matching (>3 chars)
     - Highest score wins
  4. Return best match or default response
```

### Scoring System:
- Exact keyword match: +10 points
- Partial match (>3 chars): +5 points
- Minimum threshold: 5 points

### Example:

**User Query:** "How to register property?"  
**Words:** ["how", "register", "property"]

**Scoring:**
- Property Law entry: 
  - "register" matches "registration" ‚Üí +10
  - "property" matches "property" ‚Üí +10
  - Total: 20 points ‚Üí **BEST MATCH**

**Response:** Property Law information
